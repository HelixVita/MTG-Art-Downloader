# ==== INSTRUCTIONS ====
# 1. Get your hands on a bunch of upscaled art, for example from the mpcproxies google drive.
# 2. If the content is online, download a local copy of it and place in a folder on your computer, henceforth referred to as the "upArtDir"
# 3. Replace the path below with the path to the upArtDir
upArtDir = Path("D:\\mpcproxies\\Upcaled Arts")
# 4. Open config.ini and set Only.Download.Scryfall = true
# 5. Add some cards to the cards.txt as per the README.md
# 6. Run the MTG-Art-Downloader "main.py" program
# 7. Run this "upscaled-art-finder.py" program
# 8. Done!
# If any upscaled versions were found in upArtDir, then they have now been copied into MTG-Art-Downloader/downloaded/scryfall/UpscaledArt
# Note 1: The file missingFiles.txt will contain a list of art for which no corresponding art was found in upArtDir.
# Note 2: If you wish to simply find any upscaled art regardless of artist, then remove the artist from the filenames of your scryfall art files (or change the config.ini to Naming.Convention = NAME).
